                Your task:
                Write a high-converting, SEO-optimized product post based on the following product information: ${about}.
    
                The post must:
                - Start with a catchy introduction that quickly captures attention and highlights the product's key benefit.
                - Clearly explain the main features and advantages in simple, persuasive, and engaging language.
                - Use a friendly, modern, and professional tone.
                - Include at least one practical digital marketing recommendation such as: social media ads, SEO optimization, email marketing, or influencer collaborations.
                - End with a strong, persuasive call to action that invites the reader to explore the product at this link: www.rua.com.
    
                Additional guidelines:
                - Use short, punchy sentences and easy-to-read formatting.
                - Add relevant emojis to make the post visually appealing.
                - Write around 200-300 words.
                - Avoid using bold formatting (no asterisks **) or like that ðŸŒˆ.
    
                The goal is to create an engaging post that attracts attention, builds interest, and drives traffic to www.rua.com.`;
